# Welcome to ${{values.spa_name}} contributing guide 

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to ${{values.spa_name}}! 

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.gitlab.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)
- [gitlab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/en/get-started/quickstart/gitlab-flow)
- [Collaborating with pull requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/en/gitlab/collaborating-with-pull-requests)


## Getting started

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your Gitlab account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.


For example:

```
git clone git@gitlab.com:<this-is-you>/${{values.spa_name}}.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your gitlab username. Here you're copying the contents of the contributions repository on gitlab to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd ${{values.spa_name}}
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add your-name to Contributors list"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to gitlab

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.


## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on gitlab, you'll see a `Compare & merge request` button. Click on that button.

Now submit the merge request.

Soon maintainers be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.
